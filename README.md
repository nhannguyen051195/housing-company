# housing-company
In this application, I created a housing company where users can post their own Rooms/ Apartments for rent, as long as they have an account. Customers see all available offers without account, apply for your suitable one and leave their comments on each post with authentication.
About the UI, I created a responsive design that is nicely organized both large screens and smaller ones.
I used these main following stack:
Ejs, Node.js, Express.js, Mongodb for database, Passportjs for authentication.
